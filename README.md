# Deep Learning projects 

This repository contains rojects for Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree term 2.

## Environment Setup

The projects are run in an environment with Python 3 and all necessary packages installed. The environment can be created and configured by following the steps below:

1. `conda env create -f aind-environment-osx.yml to create the environment` (for OSX)  
2. `source activate aind to enter environment`  
3. `pip install git+https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn.git to install the development version of hmmlearn 0.2.1`  

## Project 1: Build Dog Breed Classification App  

In this project, CNN models are created to classify dog breeds using transfer learning. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
